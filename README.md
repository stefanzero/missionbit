# Adhoc Website Challenge
---
Before we touch the code, look over Adhocâ€™s design spec provided on Teachable. Notice that the design spec includes information about what Bootstrap utility classes components are used.  
Also keep in mind that the website is designed to be responsive and accommodate desktop and mobile screens. So, as you work, remember to resize your browser to make sure both versions look correct!  
Some very basic starter code has been provided in `index.html`.

Try and complete this project off of the design specification pdf and the Bootstrap documentation if possible.  
If you think that you need further detailed instructions, open `INSTRUCTIONS.md`  

Remember to keep the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/navbar/) open (and make sure it is the correct version, this project uses 4.2)!
